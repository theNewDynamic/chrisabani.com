Last week Victor LaValle and I spoke at Community Bookstore in Brooklyn, NY. Restless Books has posted a recording of the conversation, which they said was "...challenging, freewheeling, and often hilarious dialogue on the complex web of transnational politics and cultural reference that informs Abani's audacious, multifacted, and, at times, brutal work."

They will also post a transcript soon. Check out the recording at [Restless Books](http://www.restlessbooks.com/blog/2014/2/3/chris-abani-at-community-bookstore).
